## üèóÔ∏è Data Pipeline Architecture

This project follows a standard Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) process:

1. **Extract**: Raw data (e.g., `customers.csv`, `orders.csv`) is extracted. If the data is not present, a synthetic data generation script creates it automatically.
2. **Transform**: The raw data is cleaned, validated, and enriched using Pandas. Business logic is applied to calculate new metrics and create analytical tables (e.g., `customer_metrics`, `monthly_summary`).
3. **Load**: The transformed, clean data is loaded into a PostgreSQL database hosted on Neon. The database schema is optimized with indexes and views for fast analytical queries.
4. **Analyze & Visualize**: The Streamlit dashboard queries the PostgreSQL database to visualize the data and provide real-time business insights.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Local Setup and Usage

Follow these steps to run the project on your local machine.

1. **Prerequisites**

   - Python 3.11
   - Git

2. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/your-username/ecommerce-analytics-pipeline.git](https://github.com/your-username/ecommerce-analytics-pipeline.git)
   cd ecommerce-analytics-pipeline
   ```

3. **Set Up the Environment**

   Create and activate a Python virtual environment:

   ```bash
   py -3.9 -m venv .venv
   ```

4. **Create the virtual environment**

   ```bash
   py -3.11 -m venv .venv
   ```

5. **Activate it**

   ```bash
   ./.venv/Scripts/Activate.ps1
   ```

6. **Install the required dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

7. **Configure the Database**

   - Sign up for a free PostgreSQL database at Neon.tech.

   - Create a file named .env in the root of the project.

   - Add your database connection string to the .env file:

      ```env
      DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@host:port/dbname"
      ```

8. **Run the ETL Pipeline**

   Execute the main pipeline script to populate your database:

   ```bash
   python -m etl.pipeline
   ```

9. **Launch the Dashboard**

   Run the Streamlit app to view the interactive dashboard:

   ```bash
   streamlit run dashboard/app.py
   ```

   The dashboard will be available at [http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501) or a similar port depending on your machine.

## üìä Dashboard Features

   The dashboard is organized into several pages for comprehensive analysis:

   1. **Overview**: High-level KPIs, daily revenue trends, and an orders vs. customers chart.

   2. **Customers**: Detailed analysis of customer segments and retention metrics.

   3. **Products**: Treemap of revenue by category and a list of the top-performing products.

   4. **Advanced** Analytics: Monthly performance, revenue growth rate, and forecasting.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Deployment

- The dashboard for this project is deployed on Streamlit Community Cloud.

- The app is linked to this GitHub repository.

- The DATABASE_URL is configured securely using Streamlit's secrets management.

- The app automatically redeploys upon any push to the main branch.
